# Family Hub - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Family Hub is a fully self-contained, self-hosted family organization app with role-based access control. It runs as a single Docker container with MongoDB embedded.

## Latest Update (March 2026)
- **Backend Refactored**: Monolithic 1652-line server.py split into 16 modular FastAPI router files with separate database.py, auth.py, and models/schemas.py
- **Admin Portal Fixed**: Replaced broken HTTP Basic Auth with session-based form login accessible via web browsers
- **Barcode Scanner Enhanced**: Camera-based scanning auto-closes on detection, product lookup uses Open Food Facts + UPC Item DB fallback, shows product image and Google search link for unknown barcodes
- **Docker Build Fixed**: Removed `emergentintegrations` from requirements.txt (platform-only), updated Dockerfile to copy full modular backend, added sys.path fix for Docker compatibility
- **Full Regression Test**: 144/144 backend tests passing, all frontend flows verified
